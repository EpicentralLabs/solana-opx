## Versioning

We follow [**Semeantic Versioning (SemVer)**](https://semver.org/) for versioning this project.

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes.
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner.
3. PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

Example:
    - ```1.2.3-beta```
    - ```4.5.6-latest```

**Please be sure to update the `package.json` version when updating a version to maintain codebase consistency. 
## Commenting Style

Write clear, concise comments above functions, classes, and complex logic to explain what and why the code does what it does.

Example:

```/solana-opx/src/hooks/usePageVisibility.ts```

```js
export function usePageVisibility() {
  // Initialize with true and update after mount
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(true)

  useEffect(() => {
    // Only access document after component mounts
    if (typeof document !== 'undefined') {
      setIsVisible(!document.hidden)

      const handleVisibilityChange = () => {
        setIsVisible(!document.hidden)
      }
```
